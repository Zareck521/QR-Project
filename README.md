## My process
I cut it up into smaller projects. First I started with the background. Then I created and positioned the white rectangle. Then I positioned the required words inside of the rectangle. I then added the QR code picture. Formated all to be and stay inside of the rectangle even when the screen was resized. Got the colors and fonts and sizes correct. 


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

I learned that 1. I don't know nearly as much as I would like and 2. I know more than I thought. I did have to look up a lot of things and ask around and some places I had to have my hand held, but I got it. I think. 

### Continued development

Everything. I need a download port in my head. 

### Useful resources

github copilot. Very important though, I set the copilot to only ask me questions to help me arrive at suitable answers. It didn't give me the answers.
